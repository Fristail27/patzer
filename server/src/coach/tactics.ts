// LLM: a small model asked "why is this a blunder?" invents a pin or an
// attack that isn't there, and even a 27B model, given only "the knight goes
// to f6" and "material is equal", called the move that allows Qxf7# "great
// development" (discussion #37). So the server works out what a move hangs,
// what it allows and what it threatens, and hands the LLM those findings.
//
// Everything is language-neutral: pieces are { type, square } and results
// are codes. coaching.ts turns them into sentences in the user's language.
